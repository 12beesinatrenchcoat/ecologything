# ecologything
**"ecologything"** is a website about stuff involving ocean zones or something.

## Reason for Existence (The website, not my own)
A project for a class I'm in. [Not sure if I'm legally allowed to be more specific than that.]
This is the source code for a little part of a project.
I was supposed to create a visual or something, but I'm bad at that, so let's make it worse by including code and syntax and whatever.

## Code Style
It's a mess. Look at your own risk.

## Credits
*to be written.*

## I found an error!
Cool. It'd kinda help if you maybe... [told me.](https://github.com/AndyThePie/ecologything/issues)
