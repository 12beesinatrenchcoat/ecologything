			<h1>Intertidal Zone</h1>
			<h2>up to 10m below sea level</h2>
			<p>The intertidal zone is the first of five benthic zones. <br>
			It is also part of the first oceanic environment (the neritic zone.) <br>
			There are some animals here, like a sea anemone, or a rock.<br>
			I don't have too much room to say things here, this layer is kinda short.<br>
			I suppose, here's a tip: look at the scrollbar. You'll need it.<br><br>
			Also, I'll have some messages here and there. Look out for those. <br>
			Have fun!</p>

			<h2>up to 200m below sea level</h2>
			<p>The second of the five benthic zones. <br>
				About the pelagic environment, it's also the last part of the neritic zone. <br>
				Climate's pretty consistent here. </p>

		<div style="height:90cm"> <!-- halfway point for sublittoral zone -->
			<p>You're halfway between the Sublittoral Zone and the Bathyal Zone. <br>
				Just thought you'd like to know. <br>
				Unless you're doing that middle-mouse-click super-fast scroll. <br style="line-height:15cm">
				Here's a nice image of a coral. <br>
				They live in the sublittoral zone. <br>

			<h1>Bathyal Zone</h1>
			<h2>up to 4000m below sea level</h2>
			<p>On the topic of the pelagic environment, this is where the oceanic zone starts. <br>
				Have you noticed the background slowly getting darker and darker? <br>
				If you did notice... you have really good eyes. I barely even notice. <br style="line-height:10cm">
				Oh, and if you're wondering, you're about 1.93% of the way to the bottom. <br>
				This is the second longest layer. <br>
				Good luck with that. <br style="line-height:100cm">
				Did you know that sperm whales dive into the Bathyal zone for food? Here's a drawing of one. <br style="line-height:200cm">
				It's really cold here, about 4 degrees Celcius (39 degrees Farenheit) here. <br>
				Not ideal for a rave.</p>

		</div>
		<div style="height:1900cm">
			<p>You've scrolled about 2100cm in total. <br style="line-height:10cm">
				You're about halfway through the Bathyal layer. <br style="line-height:20cm">
				It's quite deep.</p>

			<p>The hadal zone can only be found in trenches. <br>
				The remaining part of this goes down Challenger's Deep, the lowest part of our Earth's hydrosphere. <br>
				If you've scrolled this far, congratulations, and sorry.</p>
		</div>
		<div style="height:2480cm"> <!-- halfway point for hadal! -->
			<p>You're halfway through the Hadal Zone. <br>
				Well, a little more now. <br>
				I'm surprised you actually decided to scroll this far. <br>
				Don't worry, the result will be underwhelming.</p>

		<div id="finale" style="height:17cm"> <!-- this is the end. -->
			<p>You're crazy. <br>
				Unless you skipped to the bottom, in which case, shame on you. <br>
				But if you scrolled this far, thanks for joining me on this journey. <br>
				It was fun to program, and I hope you got some enjoyment out of it. <br>
				I hope you see how deep the ocean is now. <br> <br>
				Again, thanks for joining me on this "adventure" of sorts. <br>
				I hope you enjoyed, <br>
				have a good. <br> <br>
