		<h1 style="text-align:center; text-decoration:underline">The Benthic Environment</h1>
		<p>The <strong>Benthic Environment</strong> is the ocean floor and the surrounding area.<br>
		As the name suggests, this environment is home to the benthos, (organisms that live close to the ocean floor.) <br>
		This environment is divided into five zones.</p> <hr style="border-width:medium; border-style: dashed">
	<main>
		<!-- The main content of the page is here. The text, images, and paragraphs. -->
		<div id = intertidal>
			<h1>Intertidal Zone </h1>
			<h2>&lt200m below sea level, very shallow</h2>
			<p>The Intertidal Zone is the first and most shallow benthic zone, close to the coast. <br>
			Organisms in this zone are are adapted to living in and out of the water.</p>
				<div class="float">
					<p><img class="float" src="images/barnacle.jpg" alt="An image of a barnacle."></p> <p>
					<span class="hoverable" title="(Not to be confused for the ones in Half-Life)">Barnacles</span> are crustaceans that attach themselves to surfaces (and then live there for the rest of their life.) They live near the top of the intertidal zone, and eat plankton that pass by during a tide.</p>
					<p> Other organisms that live in the Intertidal Zone include:
						<ul>
							<li>Clams
							<li>Starfish
							<li>Sea Anemone
						</ul>

			<h1>Sublittoral Zone</h1>
			<h2>up to 200m below sea level</h2>
			<p>Where the Intertidal Zone ends is where the Intertidal Zone starts. <br>
			This zone is quite consistent in temperature, pressure, and sunlight.</p>
			<div class="floatr">
				<p>An example of a creature that lives in this zone is the sea urchin. They are omnivorous.

		<div id = bathyal>
			<h1>Bathyal Zone</h1>
			<h2>up to 4000m below sea level</h2>
			<p>From the edge of the Sublittoral Zone starts the Bathyal zone. <br>
				It’s a bit cold. (4°C/39°F) <br>
				Sunlight does not reach this zone much. As an effect, there aren’t many plants here.
				<div class="float">
					<p>
						<img class="float" src="images\Vampyroteuthis_infernalis.png" alt="A drawing of a Vampire Squid.">
						There are still organisms, however, such as the vampire squid. The vampire squid is small, red, and consume parts of decomposing organisms. It’s named the “vampire squid” due to the color of its body and eye. (It’s blue under certain lighting conditions.)
					</p> <p>
						Other animals that live in the Bathyal Zone include:
						<ul>
							<li>Jellyfish
							<li>Eels</li>
						</ul>
						<em>(Just a note, sperm whales can dive into the Bathyal Zone to hunt for prey, however, they do not typically live there.)</em>

		<div id = abyssal>
			<h1>Abyssal Zone</h1>
			<h2>up to 6000m below sea level</h2>
			<p>The largest zone in the ocean. <br>
				There are no plants here. <br>
				It’s very deep, and even colder. (almost freezing.)<br>
				Against all odds, there are organisms here!<br>
				For example, the crab, which gives me an excuse to link <a href="https://youtu.be/LDU_Txk06tM" class="link">Crab Rave.</a> That’s the only reason.</p>

					<img class="floatr" src="images/anglerfish.jpg" alt="An image of a sea urchin underwater.">
					Moving on to something more interesting, the Deep Sea Anglerfish.
					The glowing thing on their head is used as bait to get prey closer.
					Anglerfish are carnivorous.

		<div id = hadal style="display:block">
			<h1>Hadal Zone</h1>
			<h2 title="up to 11,000m below sea level" class="hoverable">the bottom of the bottom of the ocean</h2>
			<p>Found in ocean trenches, the Hadal Zone is the deepest benthic zone. <br>
				Very dark, very cold (barely over freezing,) and has extremely high pressure levels. <br>
				It’s difficult to study, but we do know a bit about it.<br>
				Animals in the Hadal Zone include:
				<ul>
					<li>Sponges
					<li>Clams
					<li>Liparid Fish</li>
				</ul>
				<p>It’s also worth noting that protists live here.</p>

<p>The benthic environment deals with the ocean floor, but what about the open ocean? <br> Well, that has to do with
