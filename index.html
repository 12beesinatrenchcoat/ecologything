			<p>The intertidal zone is the first of five benthic zones. <br>
			It is also part of the first oceanic environment (the neritic zone.) <br>
			There are some animals here, like a sea anemone, or a rock.<br>
			I don't have too much room to say things here, this layer is kinda short.<br>
			I suppose, here's a tip: look at the scrollbar. You'll need it.<br><br>
			Also, I'll have some messages here and there. Look out for those. <br>

				Here's a nice image of a coral. <br>
				They live in the sublittoral zone. <br>

			<p>On the topic of the pelagic environment, this is where the oceanic zone starts. <br>
				Have you noticed the background slowly getting darker and darker? <br>
				If you did notice... you have really good eyes. I barely even notice. <br>
				There's almost no light here. <br>
				Oh, and if you're wondering, you're about 1.93% of the way to the bottom. <br>
				This is the second longest layer. <br>
				Good luck with that. <br style="line-height:100cm">
				Did you know that sperm whales dive into the Bathyal zone for food? Here's a drawing of one. <br>
				<img src="images/spermwhale.jpg" alt="A bad drawing of a sperm whale."> <br>
				<br> It's really cold here, about 4 degrees Celcius (39 degrees Farenheit) here. <br>
				Not ideal for a rave. </p>

		<div style="height:900cm">
			<p>In the original version of this, I mentioned the vampire squid. <br>
				It was a red squid that lived in this layer. <br>

				It looks something like this. <br>

				<p> Here's a short list of animals that live in the Bathyal Zone that I haven't mentioned yet.
					<li>Jellyfish <li>Eels <li>Dragonfish </li>
				<p> See? I said it was short. <br>
				It takes up a centimeter or two. <br>

			<p>Well, this is the second to last Benthic Layer. Without an ocean trench, this is about as deep as you go. <br>
				This layer isn't the deepest (the Hadal Zone is, followed by the Bathyal Zone) <br>
				But it covers the most land. <br>
				I felt like you should know that.</p>

		<div style="height:1000cm">
			<p style="font-size:3em"><strong>Halfway point.</strong></p>
			<p>So, I feel like now is a good time to talk about animals.<br>
				An example? An Anglerfish! They're carnivorous, and the glowing thing on their head is used to lure prey. <br>
				Here's a drawing of it. <br>

				If you've scrolled this far, congratulations, and sorry.</p>

			<p>You're crazy. <br>
				Unless you skipped to the bottom, in which case, shame on you. <br>
				But if you scrolled this far, thanks for joining me on this journey. <br>
				It was fun to program, and I hope you got some enjoyment out of it. <br>
				I hope you see how deep the ocean is now. <br> <br>
				Again, thanks for joining me on this "adventure" of sorts. <br>
				I hope you enjoyed, <br>
				have a good. <br> <br>
