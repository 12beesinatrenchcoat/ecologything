		<h1>Oceanic Environments</h1>
		<p>This is a scaled representation of the oceanic environments. <br>
		<div style="height:1cm; background:darkslategrey;">
			<p>The height of this strip is equal to 1m in real life.</p>
		</div>

		<div id="intertidal" style="height:10cm">
			<h1>Intertidal Zone</h1>
			<h2>up to 10m below sea level</h2>
			<p>The intertidal zone is the first of five benthic zones. <br>
			It is also part of the first oceanic environment (the neritic zone.) <br>
			There are some animals here, like a sea anemone, or a rock.<br>
			I don't have too much room to say things here, this layer is kinda short.<br>
			I suppose, here's a tip: look at the scrollbar. You'll need it.<br><br>
			Also, I'll have food chains in the background here and now. Look out for those. <br>
			Good luck!</p>
		</div>
<!-- div height for sublittoral should add up to 190cm. -->
		<div id="sublittoral" style="height:95cm">
			<h1>Sublittoral Zone</h1>
			<h2>up to 200m below sea level</h2>
			<p>The second of the five benthic zones. <br>
				About the pelagic environment, it's also the last part of the neritic zone. <br>
				Climate's pretty consistent here.</p>
		</div>
		<div style="height:90cm"> <!-- halfway point for sublittoral zone -->
			<p>You're halfway between the Sublittoral Zone and the Bathyal Zone. <br>
				Just thought you'd like to know. <br>
				Unless you're doing that middle-mouse-click super-fast scroll. <br>
				In which case, you probably went back up here to see what was written here, huh? <br>
				I should stop, each letter adds a thousandth of a kilobyte to the file size. <br>
				Alright, see ya at the Bathyal zone.</p>
		</div>
		<div style="height:5cm">
			<p>Alright, never mind, turns out 90 centimeters isn't a lot of scroll time.</p>
		</div>
<!-- div height for hadal should add up to 3800cm. -->
		<div id="bathyal" style="height:3800cm">
			<h1>Bathyal Zone</h1>
			<h2>up to 4000m below sea level</h2>
			<p>On the topic of the pelagic environment, this is where the oceanic zone starts. <br>
				Have you noticed the background slowly getting darker and darker? <br>
				If you did notice... you have really good eyes. I barely even notice. <br style="line-height:10cm">
				Oh, and if you're wondering, you're about 1.93% of the way to the bottom.</p>

<!-- div height for abyssal should add up to 2000cm. -->
		<div id="abyssal" style="height:2000cm">
			<h1>Abyssal Zone</h1>
			<h2>up to 6000m below sea level</h2>

<!-- div height for hadal should add up to 4994cm. -->
		<div id="hadal" style="height:2497cm">
			<h1>Hadal Zone</h1>
			<h2>the deepest point of the ocean</h2>
			<p>The hadal zone can only be found in trenches. <br>
				The remaining part of this goes down Challenger's Deep, the lowest part of our Earth's hydrosphere. <br>
				If you've scrolled this far, congratulations, and sorry.</p>
		</div>
		<div style="height:2480cm"> <!-- halfway point for hadal! -->
			<p>You're halfway through the Hadal Zone. <br>
				Well, a little more now. <br>
				I'm surprised you actually decided to scroll this far. <br>
				Don't worry, the result will be underwhelming.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="finale" style="height:17cm"> <!-- this is the end. -->
			<p>You're crazy. <br>
				Unless you skipped to the bottom, in which case, shame on you. <br>
				But if you scrolled this far, thanks for joining me on this journey. <br>
				It was fun to program, and I hope you got some enjoyment out of it. <br>
				I hope you see how deep the ocean is now. <br> <br>
				Again, thanks for joining me on this "adventure" of sorts. <br>
				I hope you enjoyed, <br>
				have a good. <br> <br>
